    <p>
        Python full-stack developer is a web developer who uses Python as their main programming language to handle all aspects of building a web application. They build the user interface that is the front end as well as the back end of the website where server logic is stored using Python. For front-end development, they generally use languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but now a new front-end Python framework is also used which is named PyScript. For the backend tasks frameworks like Django or Flask are used. These developers bridge the gap between the client and the server which ensures the website is fully functional across the entire application.
