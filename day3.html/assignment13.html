        Block elements (like <div> and <p>) take up the full width of their container,
        starting on a new line. 
        Inline elements (like <span>) do not break the flow of content and only take 
        up as much space as needed.
    -->

        <p class="red-paragraph">This is a paragraph inside a block-level <div> element.</p>

    <p>
        This sentence contains a <span class="blue-word">blue</span> word using an inline element.
